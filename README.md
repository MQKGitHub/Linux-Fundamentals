## 🌐 Linux Fundamentals  

This section of my TryHackMe journey focuses on getting comfortable with Linux — the backbone of many servers, security tools, and hacking environments.

Each room builds on the last, helping me develop essential terminal skills, learn the Linux file system, and interact with remote machines through practical tasks.
